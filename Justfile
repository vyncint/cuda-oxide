# Lint every scope CI's clippy job lints, minus the per-example pass.
#
# CI runs clippy three times: over the root workspace, over
# crates/rustc-codegen-cuda (its own [workspace] for the rustc_private dylibs,
# which `--workspace` from the root cannot reach), and once per example. The
# first two are here, the root invocation spelled the way CI spells it.
# (Cargo's target-selection flags are additive and the virtual root workspace
# has no default-members, so the earlier `--all-targets --lib --tests` covered
# the same members and targets; the spelling was the only difference.)
#
# The per-example pass stays CI-only: it is one clippy run per example across
# 200-odd separate workspaces, which is a CI job rather than something to wait
# on locally.
# Run clippy with warnings as errors (root + codegen workspaces)
clippy:
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
    # Its own [workspace], so `--workspace` above stops at that boundary.
    cd crates/rustc-codegen-cuda && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Fix mode for the recipe above, and it has to cover the same ground: a warning
# the gate reports in the codegen backend had no `--fix` pass to answer it,
# because that crate's own [workspace] puts it outside every root invocation.
#
# The root line only changes spelling, to match `clippy` above: target flags are
# additive and the virtual root workspace has no default-members, so
# `--all-targets --lib --tests` already selected the same members and targets.
# Run clippy and auto-fix warnings (root + codegen workspaces)
clippy-fix:
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged
    # Its own [workspace], so `--workspace` above stops at that boundary.

# Mirror unit-tests.yml's third job, `generated-intrinsics`: the three gates a
# change under crates/cuda-intrinsics-gen has to pass. Nothing else here ran

# catalog is the majority of the intrinsic surface: it generates 35 op modules,
# against 7 that are hand-written.
#
# Needs no CUDA toolkit: `--skip-terminal` is CI's own flag for runners without
# the recorded CUDA 13.3 ptxas. Identity is llc version plus the rustc commit
# from upstream.lock; binary bytes are provenance only.
# The whole recipe is ~13s.
#
# `base_ref` is what the append-only ABI ledger is compared against. CI uses the
# pull request's base SHA and falls back to `HEAD^` for pushes; `HEAD^` is
# therefore right for a single-commit branch, and anything longer wants its own
# branch point -- `just check-intrinsics upstream/main`.
